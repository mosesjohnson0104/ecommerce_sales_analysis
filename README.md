# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis using SQL

This project simulates an E-commerce platform with Customers, Products, Orders, and Sales data. SQL queries are written to derive insights like top-selling products, revenue by category, customer lifetime value, and average order value.

## 📂 Database Structure

- `Customers`: Customer profile & location
- `Products`: Items sold with category & price
- `Orders`: Purchase records per customer
- `Order_Items`: Line items under each order

## 📊 Key SQL Queries

1. Top-selling products by quantity
2. Revenue by product category
3. Returning vs new customers
4. Average order value by month
5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

## 🔧 Technologies

- MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible
- Queries use `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `DATE_FORMAT`, `ROUND`, etc.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data modeling
- Business KPIs from raw data
- Aggregation and filtering
- Real-world schema understanding
